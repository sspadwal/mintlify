# Documentation Website - Mintlify Recreation

This project is a desktop-first documentation-style website inspired by the Mintlify homepage.

## 🚀 Recreated Sections

The following sections were built using pure HTML and CSS to match the structure and aesthetics of the original Mintlify site:

1.  **Top Navigation Bar**: Features the Mintlify logo, responsive-ready navigation links, and primary CTA buttons ("Contact sales" and "Start for free").
2.  **Hero Section**: Includes the "NEW" announcement badge, a compelling main headline, sub-headline, and an email capture form with a CTA.
3.  **Hero Image**: A large-scale SVG illustration showcasing the product interface.
4.  **Trusted By / Logos**: A grid-based section displaying company logos like Anthropic, Coinbase, and Microsoft.
5.  **Intelligence Age (Feature Highlights)**: Two-column cards explaining LLM/MCP support and Agent-driven management.
6.  **Intelligent Assistant**: A focused section highlighting the AI assistant with a UI preview.
7.  **Enterprise Section**: Details on partnership, compliance, and custom solutions with a dedicated "Explore for enterprise" CTA.
8.  **Customer Stories**: Rich card-based layout featuring case studies from Anthropic and others.
9.  **Final Call-To-Action**: A strong closure encouraging users to join the "leaders of tomorrow."
10. **Multi-Column Footer**: Comprehensive links for exploration, resources, documentation, company, and legal information.
